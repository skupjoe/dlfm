# DLFM
*it was a fork of [DiscordLastfmScrobbler](https://github.com/edvardpotter/DiscordLastfmScrobbler)*
### DOWNLOAD [HERE](https://github.com/dikey0ficial/dlfm/releases "Releases")

This app will update your Discord "Listening to" status with when you are scrobbling something to Last.FM

To run it, you need to edit config and complete three things:
## **1. Last.FM API Key**

Go to the [Last.FM API Page](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create) and sign in with your existing Last.FM username and password. It should bring you to the **Create API account** page and ask you for a few things.

It doesn't really matter what you put in most of the fields, but it should probably look something like this:

After clicking Submit you should get a confirmation page with two items: *API Key* and *Shared Secret*. The API Key is the only one you need for this, but I recommend you save both for future use just in case, as they don't actually provide a way to retrieve these later.

Copy and paste the API Key value into the config file in the `api_key = xxx` line

Then, fill field `username` with your last.fm username

Also you should fill field `check_interval` with integer number of seconds script should check new tracks. Recomended values: 1-5 seconds (if you are listening to grindcore, write 0)

## **2. Discord User Token**

For this one you'll need to use the desktop app - it won't work on mobile or in web.

If you are using the desktop app:

- Press **Ctrl+R** (or **Cmd+R** on Mac)
- Click the "*Application*" tab
- Click and expand the "*Local Storage*" section
- Click on the only entry in this section, "*https://discord.com/*"
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+I** (or **Cmd+Shift+I** on Mac)
- Wait few seconds
- Right click -> Edit Value in the field to the right of "*token*"
- Copy and paste the token value into the config file on the `token = xxx` line and remove the quotation marks from it.

## **3. App settings**

You can change there *title* and *endless* options.

If you want to change title of status (for example, "Listening to Deezer" or "Listening to Youtube Music"), change "title" value
Example:

![Example of changed title](https://i.imgur.com/9OShK3U.png)
In title you can use tags, which will be replaced with other value.

List of tags:

| Tag         |             Replaced with |
|:------------|--------------------------:|
| {{artist}}  | Track's artist(s) name(s) |
| {{album}}   | Track's album name        |
| {{name}}    | Track name                |

Also if you want to ignore not critic errors, change "*endless_mode*" to "true", else fill it with "false"

## When you're done

Save your config file as "*config.ini*" and it should look something like this:

![Finished Config File](https://i.imgur.com/vP1WXeD.png)

Now just run the executable. It should connect to Discord and immediately start setting your "*Playing*" status to whatever you're listening to on Last.FM

If it's working, it will look like this:
